# WeatherApp

This is a super basic demo. Just enough to grasp the basics.

Things will come together rapidly and I will probably be initializing the actual project within the next few days.

## Running

1. In a terminal from the project root directory , `npm start` to start the React Native server.
2. In another terminal, `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to start your device emulator.
