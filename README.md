# WeatherApp

This is a super basic demo. Just enough to grasp the basics.

Things will come together rapidly and I will probably be initializing the actual project within the next few days.

## Running

1. In a terminal from the project root directory , `npm start` to start the React Native server.
2. In another terminal from the project root directory, `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to start your device emulator.


## Development

I'm currently using vscode. It's much more agnostic than using the Android/iOS specific IDEs. xcode wil only be needed for app signing purposes.

## TODO

1. Set up MacOS development environment 
2. Veryify iOS workflow
3. Set up physical device debugging via USB
4. Find an iPhone?
5. Investigate testing via WiFi
